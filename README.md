# projectofthemonth
Every month (or just when I have the time to update), a new very-interesting-often-open-source project is dropped here as well as instructions on how to make it work. Look at it when bored, and come back irl with more dertermination.
October 2022: OK let's start this. For this month, just get this awesome project:
https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term
That'll get you covered in term of terminal personalisation for linux.
If you like old-school termials, hacker terminal, futuristic-style terminal, or just custom a terminal yourself, you're gonna be very happy.
For advanced geeks who want to compile themself:
Prerequisites: A linux distro on amd64 architecture, git and the base development program for your distro.
Arch linux:
sudo pacman -Syu git base-devel
